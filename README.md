# PLUTO
  A MHD code from http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/
  
  I plan to add non-thermal emission code in it. In fact, there are two non-thermal codes, respectively from Edmon and Yuan Qiang.
  
  There are many other HD codes, such as RAMSES, ZEUS ,VH1 ,FLASH, etc. But we choose PLUTO, because it has more examples, which is easy to be developed to a useful code.

###PLUTO code
  This is the noumenon of the whole project. There is a README in it, so I do not want to explain it here. The code is maintained by [Dipartimento di Fisica, Torino University](http://www.unito.it/). (I guess)

###Non-thermal code aura from Edmon
  This is a code not released by the author. So do not tell others, only you and me know that. (Just kidding, ha ha :laughing:)
  
  There is also a README in it. Smart you can easily know how to use it.

###Non-thermal code program (I do not find a good name now) from Yuan Qiang.(In fact, this code is a part of Galprop.)
  In fact, I got this code not from Yuan Qiang or Galprop, but from my senior partner. Unfortunately, there is no README in it. But the annotations in every subroutine are so clear that you can easily guess what the code is doing.
  
  I just add some useful scripts in it: plot.py can help you plot the results of the code, but you'd better to modify it by yourself. Sometimes, even myself cannot know what I am writing on. The others are easy to understand.

###Example code for my projects
  Oh, if you have understand the main code of PLUTO, you can immediately know how to use it. Hints: the bgenerator.py is used to generate background in terms of 'CO.fits'. And there are some redundant codes in the .py, I have not decided their end-result.
