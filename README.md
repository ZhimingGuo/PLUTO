# PLUTO
A MHD code from http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/
I plan to add non-thermal emission code in it. In fact, there are two non-thermal codes, respectively from Edmon and Yuan Qiang.
There are many other HD codes, such as RAMSES,ZEUS,VH1,FLASH,etc. But we choose PLUTO, because it has more examples, which is easy to be developed to a useful code.
